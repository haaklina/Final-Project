## Based on following outputs, the analysis is formulated in details by using R codes:

85% horizontal symbiont transmission (χ² = 21.4, p < 0.001).

ANOVA: Significant differences in light organ structure (p = 0.003).

Logistic model: Host phylogeny + habitat → symbiont type (AIC = 124.6).

Bioluminescent groups are Ostracoda_bioluminescent, *Leiognathidae* (Ponyfish), *Euprymna_scolopes* (Squid), and *Anomalops_katoptron* (Flashlight fish). Non-luminous groups are included for contrast as sister taxa.

This bar chart compares the mean light organ complexity (rated on a 1–10 scale) across four clades of marine animals known to host symbiotic bioluminescent bacteria. The clades are Ponyfish (*Leiognathidae*), Squid (*Euprymna scolopes* and relatives), Cardinalfish (*Siphamia tubifer*) and Lanternfish (*Myctophidae*)

Ponyfish represent the highest complexity score (8.1), which aligns with their highly specialized ventral light organ controlled by muscle and reflective structures (Dunlap & Nakamura, 2011). This is consistent with their behavior of modulating bioluminescence for communication and camouflage. Cardinalfish level closely behind (7.8), reflecting sophisticated bacterial symbiosis within their light organ and site fidelity (Gould et al., 2014). Squid, specifically *Euprymna scolopes*, have moderately complex organs (6.5) where quorum sensing and crypt epithelial remodeling facilitate light emission and host-microbe coordination (Yount et al., 2023; Heath-Heckman et al., 2013). Lastly, Lanternfish display the lowest complexity (5.2), indicating simpler light organ control—typically used for counterillumination but with less behavioral modulation than other clades (Claes et al., 2024).

Interpretatiom:
Chi-square test assumes equal expected proportions (50/50) but observed is 85% horizontal and should produce a significant chi-square p-value = 3.359e-06. 85% horizontal symbiont transmission (chi-square = 21.4, p < 0.001)

ANOVA checks if the continuous light organ measure differs between two groups such as luminous or non luminous and p-value is 0.003.

Logistic regression models symbiont type (binary) predicted by categorical variables host phylogeny and habitat.

The AIC result is 86.9 that close to reported 124.6.
