## Statisitical Approach:

Hypothetically 60+ species with bioluminescent symbionts across 5 marine clades analysis.

Regression for host-symbiont specificity.

ANOVA to compare light organ complexity by taxa.

Chi-square tests for symbiosis acquisition mode (vertical vs. horizontal).

### Bioluminescent groups are Ostracoda_bioluminescent, *Leiognathidae* (Ponyfish), *Euprymna_scolopes* (Squid), and *Anomalops_katoptron* (Flashlight fish). Non-luminous groups are included for contrast as sister taxa.
