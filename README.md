# Title: Bioluminescent symbioses of fish and cephalopods with bacterial symbionts.

## 1.Introduction

Include how many organisms are bioluminescent and why.

Bioluminescence is the emission of light by living organisms via biochemical including luciferin and luciferase. This feature has individually evolved several times across various taxa, which emphasizing its adaptive significance in diverse ecosystems. New details surveys have identified approximately 2,781 established bioluminescent marine species, with an extra 6,392 species from bioluminescent or prospectively luminescent genera whose luminescent status remains contradicted. This indicates that bioluminescent species constitute around 1.32% of the ~ 210,000 valid marine animal species cataloged in the World Register of Marine Species (Martini et al., 2019).

With respect to taxonomic distribution luminescent species categorized into Chordata, Arthropoda, Mollusca, cnidaria, Echinodermata and Annelida. 1,586 luminescent species are part of chordate. They are notably within Stomiiformes order. Primarily pelagic crustaceans are luminescent which encounters as 469 species. 282 luminescent species belong to Mollusca with a significant characterize from Decapodiformes such as squids. Cnidaria contains 159 luminescent species. Echinodermata encompasses 146 and Annelida 96 luminescent species (Martini et al., 2019).
