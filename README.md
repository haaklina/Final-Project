# Title: Bioluminescent symbioses of fish and cephalopods with bacterial symbionts

## Brief introduction:

Bioluminescence is the emission of light by living organisms via biochemical including luciferin and luciferase. This feature has individually evolved several times across various taxa, which emphasizing its adaptive significance in diverse ecosystems. New details surveys have identified approximately 2,781 established bioluminescent marine species, with an extra 6,392 species from bioluminescent or prospectively luminescent genera whose luminescent status remains contradicted. This indicates that bioluminescent species constitute around 1.32% of the ~ 210,000 valid marine animal species cataloged in the World Register of Marine Species (Martini et al., 2024).

## Aim and Hypothesis:

This research is a thorough review of bioluminescent symbioses between marine organisms, specifically in relation to cephalopods and fish with bacterial symbionts. In addition, the bioluminescent symbiosis plays a significant role in biomedical science. While symbiont relationships interacting between vertebrates (e.g. sharks/fishes) and invertebrates (e.g. squids) which remains understudied in response to phylogenetic analysis of cephalopods in order to understanding the food web dynamics and future climate. In order to address this problem statement, methods will be relevance systematic literature searches, and comparative analysis of luminescence mechanisms and symbiotic interactions.
